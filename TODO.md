**IMPORTANT:**

- personalized algorithm
- fix ui
- automated spam/nsfw detection using openapi or perspective api

flower doing:

* highlight mutual shared followers in user profiles, on click show a modal like followers/followings for that. in those followers/followings/followers you know, add a tab at the top
* fix the issue where going to pages with different tab sizes sometimes breaks the indicator size
* make notifications real-time and stream
* use skeleton loader for profile
* add twitter-like lists

**OTHER:**

- finish proper rate-limiting
- use Bun's SQL driver instead of sqlite since it's async

- tweetapus circles like twiter circle

- nicer animations, such as when navigating between tweets and threads
- look into all XSS vulnerabitilies
- optimize client and server

- Remove other things related to the pastes feature that are outside of the pastes extension

**Joke:**

- @Bangers account automatically quoting tweets with more than 5 likes with "Certified xeetapus banger👑"
